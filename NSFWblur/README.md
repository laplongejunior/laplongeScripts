Small (stupid?) userscript that I made to access SFW channels on porn sites.  
Yup, there are non-sexual channels on PornHub (mostly gaming) and as a result the recommendations next to the videos are... well... not really fitting the mood?  
If a channel search block or a video recommendation block are from a list of trusted models, then the result stay the same  
Otherwise, all other images (besides the site's logo *and ads*) get blurred  
First click on a blurred element disables blurring, following clicks will act as normal  

I repeat : this script won't affect the ads. If you want to preserve a SFW experience at the expense of the TOS, you'll need a dedicated adblocker on top of my script  
A planned feature, but not supported yet, is the abilty to list specific videos as blur/don't blur  
Also, this script does NOT add visual elements, so whitelist editing is done in code, at the start of the script
