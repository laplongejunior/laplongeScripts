When running on a campaign or post on Patreon, this script will (try to) locate the creator's info and add the campaign's selected currency  
As-is, Patreon loads the info in memory but doesn't disclose it anywhere! 
It is important for conscious supporters because (as of today) Patreon charges *creator-side* a 2.5% fee for converting from your currency to their currency  

So in short, this userscript allows you to setup the payment details in such a way *you* pay the fees instead of the creator  
Personally my bank charges waaaaaaay less on currency conversion than 2.5%, so in the grand scheme of things it avoids Patreon (or their providers) to siphon your support budget

Key things to know  
Audiences who visit your page have your tiers priced in their choice of supported currencies. Patreon converts your tier prices into the audienceâ€™s preferred currency. 
When receiving a membership in a different currency than your payout currency, Patreon charges you a 2.5% currency conversion fee  
Existing members who are already paying in your payout currency are not required to change anything at all.
