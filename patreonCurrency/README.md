When running on a campaign or post on Patreon, this script will (try to) locate the creator's info and add the campaign's selected currency
As-is, Patreon loads the info in memory but doesn't disclose it anywhere
It is important for conscious supporters because (as of today) Patreon charges *creator-side* a 2.5% fee for converting from your currency to their currency

So this script allows you to setup the payment details in such a way *you* pay the fees instead of the creator
Personally my bank charges waaaaaaay less on currency conversion than 2.5%, so in the grand scheme of things it avoids Patreon (or their providers) to siphon your support budget
